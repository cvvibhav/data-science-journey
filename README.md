My personal journey : Data Science

## 🚀 Journey Log

* **Day 1:** Set up my Git/GitHub repository and professional Notion journal.Today, i've set up the two most important tools in your arsenal: Git (for local version control) and GitHub (for remote backup and portfolio). You also learned and executed the fundamental add -> commit -> push cycle
* **Day 2:** Wrote my first Python script! (Variables & Data Types) - [See the code in `phase_1_python_basics/`](./phase_1_python_basics/Day_02_Python_Basics.ipynb)
* **Day 3:** Learned Python operators (math, logic) and my first data structure: Lists! - [See the code in `phase_1_python_basics/`](./phase_1_python_basics/Day_03_Operators_and_Lists.ipynb)
* **Day 4:** Learned to modify lists (`.append()`, `.pop()`) and iterate with 'for' loops. - [See the code in `phase_1_python_basics/`](./phase_1_python_basics/Day_04_Loops_and_List_Methods.ipynb)
* **Day 5:** Mastered dictionaries, the most important Python data structure! - [See the code in `phase_1_python_basics/`](./phase_1_python_basics/Day_05_Dictionaries.ipynb)
* **Day 6:** Learned to make decisions with `if/else` and write reusable code with `def`. - [See the code in `phase_1_python_basics/`](./phase_1_python_basics/Day_06_Conditionals_and_Functions.ipynb)
* **Day 7:** Built my first Python project! A Contact Book that combines lists, dicts, loops, and functions. - [See the code in `phase_1_python_basics/`](./phase_1_python_basics/Day_07_Mini_Project_Contact_Book.ipynb)
